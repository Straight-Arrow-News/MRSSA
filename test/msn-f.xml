      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this Media Miss Minute, an undocumented immigrant is accused of using TikTok to put bounties on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Also, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is accused of ratting out confidential informants to seal a deal with El Salvador's president.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-media-miss-by-the-left-texas-immigrant-accused-of-using-tiktok-to-encourage-killing-of-ice-agents">Media Miss by the left: Texas immigrant accused of using TikTok to encourage killing of ICE agents</h3>
<p>An undocumented immigrant from Mexico living in Texas is facing federal charges after the Justice Department (DOJ) said he offered cash bounties for the killing of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-accused-offering-10k-bounties-kill-ice-agents-tiktok-arrested-loaded-gun-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agents</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>Officials say Eduardo Aguilar, 23, posted videos offering <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/us-news/illegal-migrant-on-tiktok-offers-10k-for-every-ice-agent-killed-feds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10,000</a> per agent and was arrested with a loaded gun. Aguilar, who has a prior criminal record in the U.S., now faces up to five years in prison.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-media-miss-by-the-right-rubio-gave-bukele-ms-13-informants-in-exchange-for-el-salvador-prison-access">Media Miss by the right: Rubio gave Bukele MS-13 informants in exchange for El Salvador prison access</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/19/rubio-el-salvador-prison-bukele-ms13-informants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a>, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stuck a deal with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele that involved deporting nine <a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/10/19/rubio-puts-us-informants-at-risk-in-el-salvador-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS-13 gang leaders</a> – including several who were U.S. informants – to the country’s notorious CECOT prison. </p>
<p>The report says Rubio asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to terminate  those informants’ cooperation agreements with the DOJ.</p>
<p>That same arrangement later enabled the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March.</p>
<p>Critics warn the move could jeopardize U.S. intelligence operations against one of the world's deadliest gangs.</p>

<p>HELLO I'M KALE CAREY AND WELCOME TO MEDIA MISS MINUTE -- WHERE WE LOOK AT TWO STORIES THAT GET BURIED BY PARTISAN MEDIA.</p>
<p>STARTING TODAY WITH ONE BEING MISSED BY THE LEFT -- AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO IS FACING FEDERAL CHARGES AFTER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS HE OFFERED CASH REWARDS FOR KILLING ICE AGENTS ON <span class="nanospell-typo" data-cke-bogus="true">TIKTOK</span>.</p>
<p>THE D-O-J SAYS 23-YEAR-OLD EDUARDO AGUILAR POSTED VIDEOS OFFERING 10-THOUSAND DOLLARS APIECE FOR EACH AGENT KILLED.</p>
<p>AGUILAR -- WHO HAS A CRIMINAL HISTORY IN THE U-S  -- WAS FOUND WITH A LOADED GUN WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED...</p>
<p>HE NOW FACES UP TO FIVE YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON.</p>
<p>NOW TO A STORY BEING MISSED BY THE RIGHT -- THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO <span class="nanospell-typo" data-cke-bogus="true">RUBIO</span> BETRAYED U-S INFORMANTS TO CUT A DEAL WITH EL SALVADOR'S PRESIDENT.</p>
<p>UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE U.S. RETURNED NINE MS-13 LEADERS -- INCLUDING SOME WHO WERE INFORMANTS -- TO EL SALVADOR'S MAX-SECURITY <span class="nanospell-typo" data-cke-bogus="true">CECOT</span> PRISON.</p>

<p>THE SAME DEAL ALSO CLEARED THE WAY FOR THE U.S. TO DEPORT HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS TO EL SALVADOR EARLIER THIS YEAR.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the new job search shortcut: upload a few selfies, press a button and let artificial intelligence create a professional headshot. For many people, this beats booking a costly photo session and waiting for edited proofs.</p>
<p>In a time when the job market is tight, people are using AI to save time and money on resumes, cover letters and even interview prep. According to the <a href="https://www.careergroupcompanies.com/market-trend-report-insights">2025 Market Trend Report</a> from recruitment firm Career Group Opportunities, 65% of job seekers use AI during their application process. That includes 19% for resumes, 20% for cover letters, 9% for headshots, 7% for interview practice and 5% each for work samples and career guidance.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-photographer-s-perspective">A photographer’s perspective</h3>
<p>For professional photographers, however, AI headshots are hitting close to home.</p>
<p>“Headshots are a huge part of my business, and it’s one thing that I specialize in,” said <a href="https://zachdalin.com/">Zach Dalin</a>, a St. Louis-based photographer and videographer who has worked in the industry since 2013.</p>
<p>“[AI headshots are] cool. I use AI and all these AI tools in a lot of aspects of my business,” he said. “It’s amazing the technology we have out there.”</p>
<p>He adds that while AI can generate a polished image, it still falls short of what a human photographer provides. </p>
<p>“Although you can AI-generate a great image of yourself, you’re not going to get that confidence and approachability," he said. "Those are things that take a trained professional.”</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-limits-of-ai-emotion">The limits of AI emotion</h3>
<p>According to Dalin, the biggest gap between AI and human photography is emotion.</p>
<p>“Part of what we do is taking the picture, obviously,” he explained, “but the other part is eliciting a certain emotion, a certain facial expression, a certain body language. These are things that AI tools simply won’t be able to do. You’re getting about 80% of the way there — a professional photographer can get you that extra 20%.”</p>
<figure style="width: 300px; float: left; border: 2px solid #7f7f7f; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 0 1rem 1rem 0; " class="fact-card alignleft wp-block-san-fact-card" >

<div class="fact-card__wrapper">
<p>Around <mark style="background-color:var(--wp--custom--palette--text--on-dark--brand)" class="has-inline-color">two-thirds of job seekers use AI when applying</mark>, 20% for cover letters, 19% for resumes and smaller shares for headshots (9%), interview prep (7%) and career help (5%).</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="120" height="65" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-and-Job-Applicants.png" alt="" class="wp-image-505972" style="width:125px" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-and-Job-Applicants.png 720w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-and-Job-Applicants.png?resize=300,162 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>
</p></div>
</p></div>
</figure>
<p>That emotional nuance can make the difference between a photo that feels alive and one that looks fake. While AI headshots may help someone land an interview, Dalin says the connection that brings photos to life still requires a human touch.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-is-already-changing-the-industry">AI is already changing the industry</h3>
<p>Dalin isn’t anti-AI. In fact, he uses it daily.</p>
<p>Inside photo-editing software like Adobe's Photoshop, generative AI allows him to change colors and fine-tune details in seconds. He also uses “AI culling,” software that sorts through thousands of photos from a wedding to instantly identify the best shots.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of AI tools in the photography space, and they’re only getting better,” he said. “As a professional, I can either fight it or embrace it. I choose to embrace it and provide a better experience for my customers.” </p>
<p>He also uses a service called Spot My Photos, which relies on facial recognition to send event guests professional photos directly to their phones, thanks to AI. “Guests want high-quality, flattering photos — and they get them instantly,” Dalin said.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-workers-and-employers-both-rely-on-ai">Workers and employers both rely on AI</h3>
<p>Dalin’s adaptation reflects a broader trend in the workplace. According to Ivanti’s 2025 Technology at Work report, <a href="https://san.com/cc/employees-use-ai-more-than-bosses-realize-keeping-secret-advantage-quiet/">42% of office workers utilize AI tools</a>, such as ChatGPT, during work hours.</p>
<p>And while candidates are turning to AI to help with job applications, the companies hiring them are doing the same. The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/03/ai-hiring-human-touch-recruitment/">World Economic Forum</a> reports that 88% of employers use AI to screen candidates. Big-name companies, such as Google and Goldman Sachs, which received more than 315,000 internship applications in 2024, now rely on AI to filter out highly qualified candidates during initial reviews.</p>
<p>That’s why many HR professionals stress the importance of optimizing resumes for applicant tracking systems, software that determines whether a candidate even makes it to a human recruiter.</p>
<p>But not every use of AI pays off. The <a href="https://www.resume-now.com/job-resources/careers/ai-applicant-report">2025 AI and the Applicant Report</a> from Resume Now found that 62% of hiring managers are most likely to reject AI-generated resumes that feel impersonal or lack a human touch.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovate-or-die-and-the-future-of-photography">‘Innovate or die’ and the future of photography</h3>
<p>While some photographers are exploring AI to streamline editing or enhance creativity, others are cautious — unsure how far technology might go in reshaping their field. A 2025 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/">Pew Research</a> study found that 52% of workers across industries worry about AI’s impact on their jobs, and 32% believe it will lead to fewer opportunities overall.</p>
<p>Dalin understands that hesitation, but isn’t overly worried about being replaced anytime soon.</p>
<p>“For example, I’m also a wedding photographer,” he said. “I don’t think a bride and groom are going to get to the point, at least not for a while, where they say, ‘I don’t need a wedding photographer anymore — I’ll just upload some random pictures of myself in pajamas, and it’ll put a bridal dress on me and a tux on my fiancé.’ Maybe that happens eventually, but photographers will just have to pivot, adjust, and offer a better level of service.”</p>
<p>For now, he believes the heart behind photography remains impossible to replicate.</p>
<p>“It absolutely is going to affect the photography industry. It already is,” he said. “But these tools aren’t going anywhere. So innovate or die. Find a way to embrace them, use them to offer a better experience — and your business will thrive.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Musician Kenny Loggins is asking President Donald Trump to remove an artificially generated video that features one of his songs. This is the latest instance of the Trump administration using others’ content to boost its political narrative.</p>
<p>On Saturday, <a href="https://san.com/cc/nationwide-no-kings-protests-expected-to-draw-millions/">as millions of Americans took part in “No Kings” demonstrations</a>, Trump posted an AI video of himself flying a fighter jet that dumps feces on protesters. Loggins’ song “Danger Zone” can be heard during the entire clip. The video, which some Republicans said was used to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/20/congress/mike-johnson-trump-poop-video-00615255#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20president%20uses%20social%20media%20to%20make%20the%20point.">make a point</a>, was criticized <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5564805-hakeem-jeffries-donald-trump-ai-feces-video/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWell%2C%20that%20video%20is%20deeply%20unserious%2C%20deeply%20unpresidential%2C%20and%20deeply%20un%2DAmerican%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jeffries%20said%20late%20Monday%20in%20an%20interview%20on%20CNN%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CErin%20Burnett%20OutFront.%E2%80%9D">by other groups</a> as “deeply unserious” and “deeply unpresidential.”</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-loggins-respond">How did Loggins respond?</h3>
<p>Loggins released a statement following <a href="https://san.com/cc/no-kings-posters-trumps-ai-video-and-americas-waning-civility/">the video</a>, saying he did not authorize Trump to use the song. </p>
<p>“Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Loggins, Italian composer Giorgio Moroder and fellow songwriter Tom Whitlock wrote the song for the 1986 film “Top Gun.” The song has become strongly associated with jet fighters, as the film centers on a group of U.S. Navy fighter pilots. </p>
<p>In his statement, Loggins called for national unity while saying he didn't understand why any musician would want their music to be used to divide the country. </p>
<p>“We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic,” he wrote. “There is no 'us and them' – that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us."</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-other-artists-complained-about-this-before">Have other artists complained about this before?</h3>
<p>In the last year, nearly a dozen other musicians have criticized Trump for using their music without approval.</p>
<p>During the 2024 election season, five musicians spoke out against the Trump campaign’s use of their songs. Representatives for Beyoncé, for example, sent Trump a cease and desist after his campaign posted a video of him getting off a plane while her song “Freedom” played. Beyoncé granted Democratic candidate Kamala Harris permission to play the song when she came onstage during campaign rallies.</p>
<p>Trump’s team <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/22/beyonce-blocks-trump-use-of-her-song-freedom-kamala-harris">eventually deleted</a> the video. </p>
<p>Celine Dion <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xlj48pl42o">also criticized</a> Trump’s use of her song “My Heart Will Go On.” Her team said the singer had not approved the usage and that she does not endorse any usage of it by Trump. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-the-trump-administration-responded-to-the-complaints">Has the Trump administration responded to the complaints?</h3>
<p>Neither Trump nor his team has publicly spoken about Loggins’ statement. </p>
<p>Other publications, including <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/kenny-loggins-slams-donald-trump-danger-zone-ai-video-1236556964/">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5580328/kenny-loggins-donald-trump-ai-video">NPR</a>, reached out to the White House for comment. However, instead of receiving a response, White House spokesperson Davis R. Ingle sent an image of “Top Gun” stars Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer with the caption, "I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED."</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Joe Biden has finished a round of radiation therapy as he combats an aggressive form of prostate cancer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/us/politics/biden-cancer-treatment-radiation-therapy.html">according to multiple media outlets</a>. However, a spokesperson for the former president said that does not mean an end to Biden’s fight against the disease.</p>
<p>A Biden spokesperson <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-completes-round-of-radiation-therapy-aggressive-prostate-cancer/">confirmed to CBS News</a> Monday that the 82-year-old former president completed several weeks of radiation therapy at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>His communications team <a href="https://san.com/cc/biden-getting-radiation-therapy-to-treat-prostate-cancer-report/">announced earlier this month</a> that the former president had been receiving the treatment for several weeks.</p>
<p>“He rang the bell today,” Biden spokesperson Kelly Scully told CBS, referring to the symbolic marking of significant steps in a cancer patient’s recovery. </p>

<p>The former president’s daughter, Ashley Biden, commemorated the medical milestone by sharing a video of her dad ringing the bell on Instagram.</p>
<p>“Rung the bell!” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQC4XVjkXRZ/">the caption read.</a> “Thank you to the incredible doctor, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful.” </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-remaining-treatment-steps-unclear">Remaining treatment steps unclear</h3>
<p>Biden’s office did not reveal any further treatment he may undergo. In May, Biden announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. The announcement raised new questions about his health during his time in the White House.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8634-prostate-cancer">According to the Cleveland Clinic</a>, prostate cancer can be treated in a variety of ways, including radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and surgery. Biden also had an operation to remove skin cancer in September. </p>
<p>Biden’s office did not disclose whether this step <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-rings-bell-after-completing-radiation-therapy-cancer/story?id=126700915">marks a full completion</a> of his radiation treatment for his prostate cancer. </p>
